You have multiple CSV files, each representing a week's sales data for a different store. These files contain information about products sold, including date, category, quantity, price, and discount.

Your goal is to write a Python program that:

Imports all sales data into a usable format.
Cleans the data by removing errors and filling in missing values.
Calculates additional information like net price (Net_Price = Price × (1 - Discount)) and total revenue (Total_Revenue = Quantity × Net_Price) for each sale.
Combines data from all stores into a single overview.
Summarizes the combined data by calculating total quantity sold and total revenue for each product.
Saves the summary results to a new CSV file.
